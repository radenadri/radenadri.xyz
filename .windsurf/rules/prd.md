# PRD – Personal Portfolio Website for Adriana Eka Prayudha

A clean, minimalistic portfolio website showcasing Adri’s frontend development skills, projects, and experience.  
The design should resemble the reference (scrollable, simple, elegant), optimized for both desktop and mobile.

---

## Problem Statement

Recruiters and potential clients need a simple yet impactful way to understand Adri’s skills, experience, and past projects.  
Current CVs are static and fail to showcase design sensibility or interactive coding abilities.  

The website will serve as a live portfolio and CV replacement to highlight frontend skills and Adri’s minimalistic design approach.

## Narrative

Imagine a recruiter opening Adri’s portfolio link.  
Instead of a dense PDF, they’re greeted with a sleek, fast, minimalistic site that feels modern and professional.  

The scrolling layout flows naturally from **introduction → experience → projects → skills → contact**.  
The design itself subtly communicates Adri’s frontend abilities (responsive, clean, attention to typography and spacing).  

Each project card feels alive, showcasing not just the deliverable but Adri’s thought process and technical contribution.  
By the end, the visitor feels confident in Adri’s technical ability, design sensibility, and professionalism — prompting them to reach out.

## Success Metrics
- Portfolio link included in CV → Increased recruiter response rate.  
- Avg. session duration > 1 minute (visitors explore beyond intro).  
- At least 3 inbound opportunities within first 6 months.  
- Positive feedback from peers and mentors on design quality.

## Technical Considerations
