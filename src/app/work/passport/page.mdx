# Passport - HRIS

Modern attendance solution for employees and HR teams. Applied in my previous company, Pentacode.

## Overview

- Role: Frontend Developer
- Stack: Flutter, Firebase 
- Timeline: 2024  

## Goals

Create a secure and efficient **attendance management system** that simplifies daily employee check-ins and check-outs while maintaining data accuracy through biometric and geolocation verification.  

The product aims to streamline HR operations by centralizing attendance, leave requests, and overtime approvals into a single mobile and web platform.

## Scope of Work

**Passport** is a mobile app that designed to increase employee attendance efficiency and ensure workplace security that applied in my previous company, Pentacode.  
It supports multiple verification methods (fingerprint, facial recognition, and GPS location) for flexible yet secure check-in/out.  

The system also provides HR with powerful tools to monitor attendance patterns, approve leave, and manage overtime seamlessly.  

As part of the development, I was responsible for:  
- Building **mobile app** using Flutter.  
- Integrating **REST API** with Laravel backend.
- Implementing **JWT Authentication** for secure user management.
- Implementing **Firebase Cloud Messaging** for push notifications.

## Highlights

- **Authentication** with JWT.  
- **Biometric Attendance** with fingerprint/face recognition.  
- **GPS Attendance** with GPS location verification.  
- **Attendance Reports** with detailed daily, weekly, and monthly insights.  
- **Leave Approval System** with built-in role-based permissions for HR and managers.  
- **Overtime Management** that integrates directly with payroll and approval workflows.
